            What Me Worry? Please replace the image above and introduce yourself.
            Explore your editor and find out what features it has for
            helping you write HTML. Feel free to use any HTML tags you
            come across.
            In your introduction, answer the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>My name is Dominic Landon</li>
                <li>My major was visual communication but the classes are up in Dayton and I can't drive yet so
                  had to switch to web design.</li>
                <li>I have not done any web development before.</li>
                <li>Not entirely sure what I hope to get out of this course, probably
                just some knowldege of developing webs.</li>
                <li>I'm settling with Atom.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            When you're done, submit a link to your page on github via
            the elearn dropbox. If you have any problems, don't stress. Talk
            to me before class next week and we'll go through it again.
